# A Socket Runtime desktop example with Filesystem 

This app uses Socket's built-in `socket:fs/promises` module which provides a promise-based API for interacting with the filesystem. It is similar to Node.js's [`node:fs/promises` module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api).

# Build instructions

1. Install the Socket SDK compiler following instructions [here](https://socketsupply.co/docs).
2. Run the application with `ssc build -r`.
